# Emotion-detection-system


The Emotion Detection System is a machine learning project built using TensorFlow and Keras. It identifies emotions such as Angry, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise from grayscale facial images. The system trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into these five categories, providing a robust and scalable solution for emotion recognition.

#Features

Image Preprocessing: Automatically resizes and rescales images to improve model performance.

Emotion Classification: Detects five distinct emotional categories.

Model Serialization: Saves the trained model architecture and weights for reuse.

Customizable: Easily expandable to include additional emotions or data.

#Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras

Data Augmentation: Keras ImageDataGenerator

File Formats: JSON (model architecture), HDF5 (model weights)

Hardware Requirements: GPU recommended for faster training
